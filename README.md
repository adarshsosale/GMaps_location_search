# GMaps_location_search
Dynamic Maps search that searches Google Maps for establishments in an area. Uses the Google Places API to find the number of establishments when a location is entered.

It also uses Local Cache on Chrome to temporarily store the LatLong coordinates between pages. This keeps the code cleaner since these pages use two different API functions.
